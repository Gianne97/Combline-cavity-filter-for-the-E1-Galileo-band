The CST CAD models are:
- xx for the complete response of the E1 Galileo band and the inductive coupling
- xx for the complete response of the E1 Galileo band and the capacitive coupling
- xx for the complete response of the Iridium band and the inductive coupling
- xx for the complete response of the Iridium band and the capacitive coupling
- yy for the external quality factor with inductive coupling at the center frequency of the E1 Galileo band
- yy for the external quality factor with capacitive coupling at the center frequency of the E1 Galileo band
