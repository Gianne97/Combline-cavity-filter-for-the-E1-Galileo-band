The CST CAD models are:
- IndEndCoupling.cst for the complete response of the filter with the inductive coupling
- CSTEndCoupling.cst for the complete response of the filter with the capacitive coupling
- IndEndCoupling_QE.cst for the external quality factor with inductive coupling
- CSTEndCoupling_QE.cst for the external quality factor with capacitive coupling
- IndEndCoupling_QE.m MATLAB script for the MATLAB-CST API
- CapEndCoupling_QE.m MATLAB script for the MATLAB-CST API
